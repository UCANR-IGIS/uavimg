Create world files and projection files for UAV images

\details{
This function creates \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidecar_file}{sidecard}
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_file}{world files} and/or 
projection files that are required to view raw images in GIS software such as
ArcGIS and QGIS. 

\emph{Note: this function has been tested with JPG files from several DJI cameras. It has not yet been adapted for TIF files from multispectral cameras, and may  not work with those format.}
  
Note that the parameters in the world file are taken exclusively from the image 
metadata, and will be \strong{approximate at best}. For a more accurate image placement, 
process the images with photogrammetry software.

If your objective is to open the images in ArcGIS or QGIS, then generating the \code{aux.xml} files should be all you need. \code{aux.xml} files are \href{http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/manage-data/raster-and-images/auxiliary-files.htm}{ESRI auxillary files} for raster layers. To be read by GIS software, they should have the same name as the image file with 'aux.xml' added on. aux.xml files can contain a lot of info about a raster layer, including statistics, the rotation info, coordinate reference system, and other stuff. If generated by this function, they will contain projection and rotation info only. Note also \strong{any existing aux.xml files will be overwritten}. aux.xml files are the only sidecar file that ArcGIS software supports for reading the projection info. 

World files are small text files with extensions \code{jpw} and \code{tfw} for
JPG and TIF files respectively. To be read by GIS software, they must 
have the same basename as the image and be saved in the same directory. Both ArcGIS and QGIS read world files, however they are not needed if the same info is available in an aux.xml file.

\code{prj} files contain just the Coordinate Reference System info. They do not seem to be recognized for rasters by ArcGIS, however QGIS picks them up.
